npx is npm ka advance version.

1. App.js -> This is components. Whatever we create inside this (That like functions).
2. index.js -> Road HTML content to the page.
3. We can return only single element. 
    - function App() {
            return (
                <div>
                    <h1>Hello World</h1>
                    <div>Learning React</div>
                </div>
            );
        }
    - Thats how we return multiple element

4. When load components -> Write in components file "rafce" due to ES7 extention of vs code
5. during load components type components name when it suggest enter tab it will import file
6. We dont write class in components return we write className
